## 1.1.0 (feature release)

üÜï New features:

- Add `govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` class

  Adds `.govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` and deprecates `.govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` in order to fix the typo in the class name. Please consider updating your code as the next major release will remove the deprecated class.

  ([PR #859](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/859))

- Allow panel component title heading to be customisable.

  You can now specify a heading level by providing
  `headingLevel: <number>` parameter. Default is `2`.
  ([PR #853](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/853))

- Update date input component  

  Allow the `name` and `id` attributes to be passed individually for each input item.

  Rely on `classes` instead of item names to set the width of input items.

  Add default (day, month, year) date input items if no items are being specified

  ([PR #857](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/857))

- The typography scale can now be converted from pixels to rem automatically,
  with pixels also being provided as a fallback for older browsers.

  This feature is disabled by default - in order to use it you will need to set
  `$govuk-typography-use-rem: true` and ensure that `$govuk-root-font-size` is
  set to the effective size of your root (html) element. For new projects, this
  should be the default of 16px so you don't have to do anything. For projects
  that use alphagov/govuk_template this should be 10px.

  The intention is to enable this by default in the next major version:
  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/868

  ([PR #858](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/858))


üîß Fixes:

- Remove mistakenly applied 5px bottom margin from radio and checkbox
  labels.
  ([PR #883](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/883))

- Apply `display:block` to `.govuk-main-wrapper`

  In IE11 `main` element is set to `display:inline` so padding
  and margins aren't applied.
  ([PR #863](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/863)))

- Line-heights are now converted from pixels to relative 'unit-less' values
  in order to prevent issues when resizing text in the browser.
  ([PR #837](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/837) and
   [PR #848](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/848))

- Add bottom margin to Tabs component
  All components (or outer layer components) have a bottom margin
  applied to them so spacing feels automatic.
  ([PR #841](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/841))

- Update Crown copyright link
  Update the Crown copyright link on the National Archives so
  we don't send users on an unnecessary redirect.
  ([PR #824](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/824))

- Fixes radio and checkbox labels extending full width of page
  ([PR #821](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/821))

- Prevent the exclamation mark in the warning text component from being
  selectable, which also excludes it when it is copied as part of a wider body
  of text
  ([PR #856](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/856))

- Add customised colours handling for warning text

  By adding a border to this component, when a user customises their colour settings
  they will still see a circle even if the background is removed.
  ([PR #852](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/852))

- Fixes a bug where the phase banner incorrectly uses a font-size of 19px when
  global styles are enabled
  ([PR #877](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/877))

- Add outlines to Radios and Checkboxes for customised colour users

  Now when a [user customises their colours](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/),
  they should see a focus state on both Radios and Checkboxes.
  ([PR #854](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/854))

- Add outline to tag for customised colour users

  Now when a [user customises their colours](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/),
  the tag component still keeps it's meaning.
  ([PR #855](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/855))

- Define size of table in `px` rather than `em`

  This brings the styling of tables inline with rest of GOV.UK Frontend which no longer uses `em` for measurements.

  This change very slightly increases the padding of table cells on mobile viewport as the use of `em` meant the font size set in the table was used to calculate padding. `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` of cells increase by 1.5px respectively which very slightly increases the height of the table on mobile.

  In the unlikely case that your UI has a dependency on tables being a certain fixed height of mobile viewport, this change might affect you.

  ([PR #845](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/845))

- Fix header component's reliance on markup whitespace

  We have had issues where the header component can render incorrectly if the markup contains whitespace,
  for example if it has been pretty printed.

  This changes the header component to use float based columns similar to how the grid system works.

  ([PR #884](httqps://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/884))

üîß Fixes:

- Reduce margin-bottom on the hint when following a default or small labe
  This reduces the margin-bottom of the hint by 5px after a default

- Update JavaScript installation instructions
  ([PR #808](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/808))

## 0.0.32 (Breaking release)

**This release changes the name of package.** It's now published as `govuk-frontend` on `npm`.

üí• Breaking changes:

- The default build of the GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript now does not initialize all components automatically.

  This allows you to initialize only the components you need, and gives you finer control over when the JavaScript for GOV.UK Frontend runs.

  To migrate your project you need to change
  ```html
    <script src="{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js"></script>
  ```
  to
  ```html
    <script src="{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js"></script>
    <script>window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll()</script>
  ```

  Now, if you only want to initialize a specific component you can now do so by:
  ```html
    <script src="{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js"></script>
    <script>
      var Button = window.GOVUKFrontend.Button
      new Button(document).init()
    </script>
  ```

  Note: If you are importing JavaScript with a bundler, this is not likely to change anything for you.
  ([PR #759](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/759))

- Consistently structure the Details and Button component, so that they can be instantiated the same as the other components.

  If you're using `GOVUKFrontend.initAll()` you do not need to make any changes, otherwise you need to change
  ```html
    <script>
      new Button().init()
      new Details().init()
    </script>
  ```
  to
  ```html
    <script>
      new Button(document).init()

      var $details = document.querySelectorAll('details')
      nodeListForEach($details, function ($detail) {
        new Details($detail).init()
      })
    </script>
  ```
  ([PR #761](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/761))

- All sass-mq settings have now been made private. We are now exposing new
  settings to allow you to customise breakpoints and responsive behaviour:

  - `$govuk-breakpoints` - Map of breakpoint definitions
  - `$govuk-show-breakpoints` - Whether to show the current breakpoint in the
    top right corner
  - `$govuk-ie8-breakpoint` - Breakpoint to rasterize to for IE8

  If you are overriding any settings prefixed with `$mq-` in your application
  you will need to update to the use the new `$govuk-` prefixed settings.

  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))

- Font settings have been renamed:

  - `$govuk-font-stack` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family`
  - `$govuk-font-stack-tabular` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family-tabular`
  - `$govuk-font-stack-print` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family-print`

  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))

- Spacing has been refactored. You will need to update Sass that currently uses GOV.UK Frontend spacing:

  - Instead of
  ``` css
  $govuk-spacing-scale-*
  ```
  use
  ``` css
  govuk-spacing(*)
  ```
  where `*` is the number on the spacing scale. The scale itself has remained the same so that `$govuk-spacing-scale-3` corresponds to `govuk-spacing(3)`. This change allows us to control the error messaging when incorrect values are used and to deprecate variables. The values of spacing variables can also be overridden by consumers.

  - Instead of:
  ``` css
  @include govuk-responsive-margin($govuk-spacing-responsive-2, "bottom");
  @include govuk-responsive-padding($govuk-spacing-responsive-2, "bottom");
  ```
  use
  ``` css
  @include govuk-responsive-margin(2, "bottom");
  @include govuk-responsive-padding(2, "bottom");
  ```
  This change, again, allows us to control the error messaging since spacing variables are not exposed directly. Also, the spacing scale itself has not changed so that `$govuk-spacing-responsive-2` corresponds to `2` when passed to the padding and margin mixins.

  This PR also updates tests and sass-docs of spacing variables and helpers.

  Additionally, this PR hardcodes the value of `$govuk-gutter`, see PR for more details.

  ([PR #779](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/779))

- Remove `pageStart` block from template, as could result in rendering issues in older IE.
  ([PR #765](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/765))

- You should no longer call the `mq` mixin directly - you should replace any
  calls to it from your own code with `govuk-media-query` which accepts the same
  arguments. All mixins and settings that start with `mq-` should be considered
  private ‚Äì they could be removed in the future without notice.
  ([PR #763](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/763))

- All of the shorthand 'font' mixins (e.g. `govuk-font-bold-80`,
  `govuk-font-regular-tabular-19`), have been removed and replaced with calls to
  a new mixin `govuk-font`. If you are using these mixins in your application
  you will need to update your code to call `govuk-font` instead.

  ([PR #772](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/772))

- The font maps are no longer as individual variables (e.g. `$govuk-font-80`) -
  they are all now part of one single `$govuk-typography-scale` map. Instead of
  passing font maps to `govuk-typography-responsive` you should now pass the
  desktop font size (e.g. `govuk-typography-responsive(80)` or
  `govuk-typography-responsive($size: 80)`.

  ([PR #772](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/772))

- All organisation variables (e.g. `$govuk-cabinet-office`) have been moved into
  a single `$govuk-colours-organisations` map. If you need to use an
  organisation colour in your own code, you should use the new
  `govuk-organisation-colour` function:

  ```scss
  .element {
    color: govuk-organisation-colour(cabinet-office);
  }
  ```

  Note that this function will return 'web-safe' colours by default. You can
  pass $websafe: false to get the non-websafe colour.

- The colour palette variables (e.g. `$govuk-green`) have been moved into a
  new single `$govuk-colours` map. If you need to reference a colour within your
  application you should use the new `govuk-colour` function:

  ```scss
  .element {
    color: govuk-colour("green");
  }
  ```

  Tints (`$govuk-green-50`, `$govuk-green-25`) have been removed from the colour
  palette.

- A number of the colours have been renamed to use more neutral names:

  - `mauve` ‚Üí `light-purple`
  - `fuchsia` ‚Üí `bright-purple`
  - `baby-pink` ‚Üí `light-pink`
  - `mellow-red` ‚Üí `bright-red`
  - `grass-green` ‚Üí `light-green`

- The 'circle shape' object (`.govuk-circle`) which was used by the warning text
  component's '!' icon has been removed and the `govuk-warning-text__icon` class
  has been updated to make it circular without the need for another class.

  ([PR #782](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/782))
- Removal of `govuk-prose-scope`
  We don't have confidence that the prose scope is well understood ‚Äì
  without further research / better documentation it's safer to remove it for now.

  If you are currently using prose-scope, you should revert to applying classes to
  individual headings, lists and hr elements.
  In version [0.0.29-alpha](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v0.0.29-alpha)
  release we have added the option to enable global link and paragraph styles.

  If you're using a recent version of the Private Beta Prototype kit,
  this is enabled by default.

  ([PR #778](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/778))

- Make override classes consistently verbose
  Based on [feedback from the community](https://gist.github.com/nickcolley/f135e89ed4b679355b0ab47135b38ee8)
  we have made the override classes consistent where previously some where verbose and some where shorthand.

  We've made the decision to remove the 'r' for responsive, this was hard to remember and users found this confusing.

  To migrate you will need to replace any instances of:

  - `.govuk-!-f-{size}` with `.govuk-!-font-size-{size}`
  - `.govuk-!-w-{weight}` with `.govuk-!-font-weight-{weight}`
  - `.govuk-!-m{direction}-r{scale}` with `.govuk-!-margin-{direction}-{scale}`
  - `.govuk-!-p{direction}-r{scale}` with `.govuk-!-padding-{direction}-{scale}`

  For example if you were using:
  - `.govuk-!-mb-r5` you would need to change this to `.govuk-!-margin-bottom-5`
  - `.govuk-!-f-24` you would need to change this to `.govuk-!-font-size-24`

  See the original Pull Request for the full list of classes before and after.

- Add `govuk-main-wrapper` to `<main>` element by default.
  ([PR #742](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/742))

- Update JavaScript global namespace from 'all' to 'GOVUKFrontend',
  we intend to allow users to initialize components from this namespace.
  ([PR #747](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/747))

- Prevents focus from being lost to the inline SVGs in the header (the crown)

üÜï New features:

- Change font delivery method from Base64 encoded strings to serving WOFF2, WOFF

  serving the fonts from the assets folder as part of your application.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- The font-face is now using `font-display: fallback`. This means that the
  fallback font (Arial) will be used if NTA doesn't download within 100ms. The
  browser will then swap to NTA as long as it loads within the short swap period.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- You can now override the helpers used to generate image and font urls, for
  example if you are using sass-rails' asset-pipeline functionality.
  You can do this by setting `$govuk-image-url-function` and

üí• Breaking changes:

- Restructure project to enable it to be published as a single package

  The [new project structure]((./src/README.md)) matches our ITCSS inspired layers and is published as a single package as `@govuk-frontend/frontend`.

  You will need to:

  - Update your npm dependencies to use `@govuk-frontend/frontend`
  - Update your SCSS import paths to match the new package name and folder structure.

  If you're importing everything at once:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/frontend/all";
  ```

  If you're importing individual components:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/frontend/components/button/button";
  ```

  See the [main README](./README.md) for up-to-date installation instructions.

  ([PR #680](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/680))

- Error Messages and Hints have been moved out Label and Fieldset components.

  They are no longer nested within the label or legend.
  They are associated with the input or with the fieldset using aria-describedby.

  Hint has been made into a new component similar to Error Message.

  If you're using markup, you will need to update the old markup:

  ```HTML
  <label class="govuk-c-label" for="national-insurance-number">
    National Insurance number
    <span class="govuk-c-label__hint">
      It‚Äôs on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‚ÄòQQ 12 34 56 C‚Äô.
    </span>
    <span class="govuk-c-error-message">
      Error message goes here
    </span>
  </label>
  <input class="govuk-c-input govuk-c-input--error" id="national-insurance-number" name="national-insurance-number" type="text">
  ```

  With the new markup:

  ```HTML
  <label class="govuk-label" for="national-insurance-number">
    National Insurance number
  </label>
  <span id="national-insurance-number-hint" class="govuk-hint">
    It‚Äôs on your <i>National Insurance card</i>, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‚ÄòQQ 12 34 56 C‚Äô.
  </span>
  <span id="national-insurance-number-error" class="govuk-error-message">
    Error message goes here
  </span>
  <input class="govuk-input govuk-input--error" id="national-insurance-number" name="test-name-3" type="text" aria-describedby="national-insurance-number-hint national-insurance-number-error">
  ```

  If you're using macros:

  The fieldset macro no longer accepts `legendHintText` or `legendHintHtml` -
  these parameters are now passed to the hint component which accepts `text` or
  `html`. The date-input, checkboxes and radios components have been updated to
  use the new Hint component.

  The label macro no longer accepts `hintText` or `hintHtml` - these parameters
  are now passed to the hint component which accepts `text` or `html`. The
  file-upload, input, select and textarea components have been updated to use the
  new Hint component.

  For example, this example macro call for a File Upload component:

  ```njk
  {{ govukFileUpload({
    "id": "file-upload",
    "name": "photo",
    "label": {
      "text": "Upload your photo",
      "hintText": "Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder."
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  would now be:

  ```njk
  {{ govukFileUpload({
    "id": "file-upload",
    "name": "photo",
    "label": {
      "text": "Upload your photo"
    },
    "hint": {
      "text": "Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder."
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  For more examples of the new markup and Nunjucks macros see the GOV.UK Design System [Question Pages pattern](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/patterns/question-pages/)

  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))

- The date-input component now sets an explicit `group` role on the fieldset
  to force JAWS 18 to announce the error message and hint.
  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))

- The label component macro now accepts an `isPageHeading` argument which determines
  whether the label itself should be wrapped in an h1:

  ```html
  <h1 class="govuk-label-wrapper">
    <label class="govuk-label">What is your National Insurance number?</label>
  </h1>
  ```

  The `.govuk-label-wrapper` removes the margins from the heading so that the
  presence of the `h1` has no effect on the styling of the label.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- Added new modifier classes for labels to allow you to create a label that
  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a
  `.govuk-label--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a
  `.govuk-heading-xl`)

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- The arguments for a fieldset's legend have been rolled up into an object. For
  example, the following macro call:

  ```
  {{ govukFieldset({
    legendText: "What is your date of birth?"
  }) }}
  ```

  would now be:

  ```
  {{ govukFieldset({
    legend: {
      text: "What is your date of birth?"
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  The `legend` object can also accept new `classes` and `arguments`

  Components that use the fieldset component have been updated to reflect these
  changes.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- The fieldset component has a new parameter legend.isPageHeading, which defines
  whether the legend text should be wrapped in an h1:

  ```html
  <legend class="govuk-fieldset__legend">
    <h1 class="govuk-fieldset__heading">Have you changed your name?</h1>
  </legend>
  ```

  The `.govuk-fieldset__heading` class ensures that the `<h1>` inherits its
  properties from the legend, so that the presence of the `h1` has no effect on
  its styling.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- Added new modifier classes for legends to allow you to create a legend that
  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a
  `.govuk-fieldset__legend--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a
  `.govuk-heading-xl`)

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))

- Remove -c -o -h layer prefixes
  ([PR #644](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/644))
  In user research and in feedback from Private Beta partners we
  learned that users didn't really understand what -o, -c and -h prefixes
  stand for or why they're useful.

  They also introduced additional cognitive load when composing classes,
  having to remember which suffix the classname contains.

  If you're using markup, you will need to:
  - Remove -o, -c and -h prefixes from class names in your markup

  For example, change:
  ```HTML
  <button class="govuk-c-button">Save and continue</button>
  ```

  Into:

  ```HTML
  <button class="govuk-button">Save and continue</button>
  ```

- Simplify grid syntax and introduce grid-row and column mixins.

  Based on user research feedback we have simplified the grid classes
  to a more concise naming structure.

  You will need to:
  - Change grid class names in your markup

  For example, change:
  ```HTML
  <div class="govuk-o-grid">
    <div class="govuk-o-grid__item govuk-o-grid__item--two-thirds">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-o-grid__item govuk-o-grid__item--one-third">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

  Into:

  ```HTML
  <div class="govuk-grid-row">
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-third">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

  We have also introduced two mixins
  to help generate additional or custom grid styles and widths,
  see original pull request for usage.

- Opt-in Global `<a>` and `<p>` styles

  Global styles are not included by default.

  This is to avoid the risk of these globals conflicting with any pre-existing globals, for example in GOV.UK Elements or GOV.UK Template.

  Hovever, we do include them in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit-private-beta) to speed up prototyping.

  To include global styles, you can set `$govuk-global-styles` variable to `true`.

- Rename captionSize table argument to captionClasses ([PR #643](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/643))

üîß Fixes:
- Link styles, as well as links within the  back-link, breadcrumbs, button,

## 0.0.22-alpha (Breaking release)

üí• Breaking changes:

- The link styles in the core layer no longer style `a` elements directly, but
  instead provide a `govuk-link` class which you will need to apply to links
  individually. (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- The link component has been removed from Frontend as the link styles have
  been moved to the core
  (PR [#431](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/431))
- Rename `legal-text` argument accepted by `legal-text` component to `text` (PR [#431](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/432))
- Rename `legal-text` component to `warning-text` (PR [#431](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/432))

üÜï New features:

- The prose scope has been extended to style links, which means links within the
  scope do not need the `govuk-link` class applied.
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- The muted link variant from the link component is now available as a core
  class (`govuk-link--muted`).

- The error summary component allows users to pass HTML for an entry in the list
  again. (PR [#428](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/428))

  links when no `href` is provided.
  (PR [#428](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/428))
- Remove redundant 'resets' for link print styles
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))
- The back link, breadcrumbs, error summary, previous / next and skip link
  components have been updated to include explicit link styling, as they
  previously relied on the global link styles.
  (PR [#427](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/427))

üè† Internal:

- Add prose scope example (PR [#429](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/429))
